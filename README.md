## Reasons for choosing react.js over other frameworks

We chose React over other frameworks such as Vue and Angular because of its component-based architecture and large ecosystem supported by a big community. While Vue is easier to learn and Angular provides a comprehensive framework, React's flexibility and popularity in the industry made it the preferred choice for a scalable and maintainable application.
